`TopOpt` is a topology optimization package written in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). To learn more and see some examples, visit the [documentation](https://juliatopopt.github.io/TopOpt.jl/stable). Numerous examples can also be found in the `test/examples` and `test/wcsmo14` directories.

## Installation

To install `TopOpt.jl`, run:

```julia
using Pkg
pkg"add TopOpt"
```

To additionally load the visualization submodule of `TopOpt`, you will need to install `Makie.jl` using:

```julia
pkg"add Makie"
```

To load the package, use:

```julia
using TopOpt
```

and to optionally load the visualization sub-module as part of `TopOpt`, use:

```julia
using TopOpt, Makie
```

## Features available

All the following features are available in TopOpt.jl but the documentation is currently lacking! Feel free to open an issue to ask about how to use specific features.

### Optimizaton domains

- 2D and 3D truss domains
- 2D and 3D continuum domains
- Unstructured ground mesh
- Linear and quadratic triangle, quadrilateral, tetrahedron and hexahedron elements in ground mesh
- Fixed and non-design domain support
- Concentrated and distributed loads

### High level algorithms and penalty types

The following high level topology optimization algorithms and penalty types are available.

- Solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP)
- Rational approximation of material properties (RAMP)
- Continuation SIMP/RAMP
- Bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) with soft-kill
- Topology optimization of binary structures (TOBS)

### Differentiable functions

All the following functions are defined in a differentiable way and you can use them in the objectives or constraints in topology optimization formulation. In TopOpt.jl, you can build arbitrarily complex objective and constraint functions using the following building blocks as lego pieces chaining them in any arbitrary way. The gradient and jacobian of the aggregate Julia function defined is then obtained using [automatic differentiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqymrMG-Qi4).

- Arbitrary differentiable Julia functions (e.g. `LinearAlgebra.norm` or `StatsFuns.logsumexp` for constraint aggregation).
- Density and sensitivity chequerboard filter: the input is unfiltered design and the output is the filtered design.
- Heaviside projection: the input is unprojected design and the output is the projected design.
- Compliance function: the input is the (filtered, projected) design and the output is the compliance.
- Volume: the input is the (filtered, projected) design and the output is the volume or volume fraction.
- Displacement: the input is the (filtered, projected) design and the output is the displacement vector.
- Stress tensor: the input is the displacement vector and the output is a vector of matrices of the element-wise microscopic stress tensors.
- Element-wise von Mises stress: the input is the (filtered, projected) design and the output is the vector of element-wise von Mises stress values.
- Matrix assembly: the input is the element-wise matrices and the output is the assembled matrix.
- Applying boundary conditions: the input is the assembled matrix without Dirichlet boundary conditions and the output is the matrix with Dirichlet boundary conditions applied.
- Element stiffness matrices: the inputs is the (filtered, projected) design and the output is the element-wise stiffness matrices for use in nonlinear elastic problems and buckling-constrained optimization.
- Element stress/geometric stiffness matrices: the inputs are the (filtered, projected) design and the displacement vector and the output is the element-wise stress/geometric stiffness matrices for use in buckling-constrained optimization.
- Neural networks re-parameterization using [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl): the input is the vector of weights and biases for any `Flux.jl` model and the output is the vector of element-wise design variables.

### Linear system solvers

- Direct sparse Cholesky decomposition based linear system solver
- Preconditioned conjugate gradient method with matrix assembly
- Matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient method

### Optimization algorithms

We use [Nonconvex.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNonconvex/Nonconvex.jl) for the optimization problem definition and solving. The following algorithms are all available using `Nonconvex.jl`.

- Method of moving asymptotes
- All the algorithms in NLopt
- Ipopt
- First order augmented Lagrangian algorithm
- Nonlinear semidefinite programming for buckling constrained optimization
- Basic surrogate assisted optimization and Bayesian optimization
- Integer nonlinear programming (design variables guaranteed to be integer)
- Sequential integer linear programming in the topology optimization for binary structures (TOBS) algorithm

### Visualization and post-processing

- End-to-end topology optimization from INP file to VTK file
- Interactive visualization of designs and deformation using [Makie.jl](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/)
- Interactive visualization of designs using Dash apps and [DashVtk](https://github.com/JuliaTopOpt/DashVtk_Examples/tree/main/src/TopOptDemo)
