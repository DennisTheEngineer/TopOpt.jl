 @article{Bendsoe1989, title={Optimal shape design as a material distribution problem}, volume={1}, ISSN={1615-1488}, DOI={10/ckwkj6}, abstractNote={Shape optimization in a general setting requires the determination of the optimal spatial material distribution for given loads and boundary conditions. Every point in space is thus a material point or a void and the optimization problem is a discrete variable one. This paper describes various ways of removing this discrete nature of the problem by the introduction of a density function that is a continuous design variable. Domains of high density then define the shape of the mechanical element. For intermediate densities, material parameters given by an artificial material law can be used. Alternatively, the density can arise naturally through the introduction of periodically distributed, microscopic voids, so that effective material parameters for intermediate density values can be computed through homogenization. Several examples in two-dimensional elasticity illustrate that these methods allow a determination of the topology of a mechanical element, as required for a boundary variations shape optimization technique.}, number={4}, journal={Structural optimization}, author={Bendsøe, M.

 @article{HuangXie2010, title={A further review of ESO type methods for topology optimization}, volume={41}, ISSN={1615-1488}, DOI={10/bjb8g5}, abstractNote={Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO) and its later version bi-directional ESO (BESO) have gained widespread popularity among researchers in structural optimization and practitioners in engineering and architecture. However, there have also been many critical comments on various aspects of ESO/BESO. To address those criticisms, we have carried out extensive work to improve the original ESO/BESO algorithms in recent years. This paper summarizes latest developments in BESO for stiffness optimization problems and compares BESO with other well-established optimization methods. Through a series of numerical examples, this paper provides answers to those critical comments and shows the validity and effectiveness of the evolutionary structural optimization method.}, number={5}, journal={Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization}, author={Huang, Xiaodong and Xie, Yi-Min}, year={2010}, month={May}, pages={671–683} }
 @article{LiuYiLiShen2008, title={Genetic evolutionary structural optimization}, volume={64}, ISSN={0143-974X}, DOI={10/dnqsd3}, abstractNote={Evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) is based on a simple idea that an optimal structure (with maximum stiffness but minimum weight) can be achieved by gradually removing ineffectively used materials from design domain. In general, the results from ESO are likely to be local optimums other than the global optimum desired. In this paper, the genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated with ESO to form a new algorithm called Genetic Evolutionary Structural Optimization (GESO), which takes the advantage of the excellent behavior of the GA in searching for global optimums. For the developed GESO method, each element in finite element analysis is an individual and has its own fitness value according to the magnitude of its sensitivity number. Then, all elements in an initial domain constitute a whole population in GA. After a number of generations, undeleted elements will converge to the optimal result that will be more likely to be a global optimum than that of ESO. To avoid missing the optimum layout of a structure in the evolution, an interim thickness is introduced into GESO and its validity is demonstrated by an example. A stiffness optimization with weight constraints and a weight optimization with displacement constraints are studied as numerical examples to investigate the effectiveness of GESO by comparison with the performance of ESO. It is shown through the examples that the developed GESO method has powerful capacity in searching for global optimal results and requires less computational effort than ESO and other existing methods.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Constructional Steel Research}, author={Liu, Xia and Yi, Wei-Jian and Li, Q.

The geometric complexity of the design is limited using a constraint on the perimeter of the design. A common approach to solve these problems is to relax the zero-one constraints and model the material properties by a power law which gives noninteger solutions very little stiffness in comparison to the amount of material used.}, number={2}, journal={Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization}, author={Stolpe, M. and Svanberg, K.}, year={2001}, month={Sep}, pages={116–124} }

Each generated iteration point is a feasible solution with lower objective value than the previous one, and it is proved that the sequence of iteration points converges toward the set of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker points. A major advantage of CCSA methods is that they can be applied to problems with a very large number of variables (say 104–105) even if the Hessian matrices of the objective and constraint functions are dense.}, number={2}, journal={SIAM Journal on Optimization}, author={Svanberg, Krister}, year={2002}, month={Jan}, pages={555–573} }
 @article{TarekRay2020, title={Adaptive continuation solid isotropic material with penalization for volume constrained compliance minimization}, volume={363}, ISSN={0045-7825}, DOI={10/gg55cc}, abstractNote={In this paper, the traditional decreasing tolerance continuation solid isotropic material with penalization (CSIMP) was extended by providing a way to adapt the penalty step between subproblems, decreasing the number of subproblems solved. Four linearly elastic, volume constrained, compliance minimization problems were used to test the efficacy of the penalty adaptation for different parameter settings. Three of the problems are common 2D test problems and one is 3D. The main factors affecting the efficacy of the penalty adaptation were identified. Experimental results confirmed that the penalty adaptation successfully reduces the number of finite element analysis (FEA) simulations needed to converge to the optimal solution when using the decreasing tolerance CSIMP (Dec-Tol CSIMP), with exponentially decaying tolerance. In particular, the number of FEA simulations required by Dec-Tol CSIMP was cut down by an average of 28.8% with no more than 4.1% increase in the objective value in the worst case. Finally, a mathematical and experimental treatment of the effect of xmin on the convergence of the SIMP algorithm was given, with recommendations for choosing a suitable value for xmin.}, journal={Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering}, author={Tarek, Mohamed and Ray, Tapabrata}, year={2020}, month={May}, pages={112880} }
